"#Content block#" refers to a piece of content, and the most common content block is the familiar paragraph (Paragraph).

In traditional Chinese typesetting, paragraphs are usually represented by indentation (two spaces) at the beginning of the paragraph. With the development of the Internet, it has gradually affected the representation of paragraphs. The most commonly used method is to increase the line spacing between paragraphs, or use blank lines to separate paragraphs.

In Markdown typesetting, paragraphs are separated by blank lines. This also coincides with many people's intuitions about content blocks, and it can be intuitively felt that different content exists in different content blocks.

## More types of content blocks

In actual use, it is not enough to rely on paragraph typesetting. It is often necessary to use Heading, List, Table, Blockquote, etc. to enrich our typesetting. These typographic styles are not only visually different, but more importantly, they express the semantics of the content to a certain extent. For example, when we see an unordered list, we can know that each list item is in an indiscriminate level relationship, while when we see an ordered list, the opposite is true.

Therefore, there are many content blocks ((20200924101225-k254i8g "types")), and different types of content blocks are defined by Markdown syntax. In other words, when users use Markdown, content blocks are formed **naturally**. #Content block/Type#

## Combined content blocks
{: id="20210104091535-sbufc1h"}

A document is a combination of some content blocks, and the content block is the basic unit. This is like Lego bricks, which can be combined using different basic modules. #Note#: the document itself is also a kind of content block. More precisely, the three content blocks of document block, list block, and block reference block are container blocks, and they can contain any other types of content blocks. #Content block/Combine#

At this point, we have been able to use content blocks to describe all content, so that we can use uniform usage to ((20200924101256-f8b1sbi "link content block")) . Logically, there is no page concept, which reduces unnecessary burdens in use and allows users to focus on the content block.
