For example, if you want to search for all heading blocks that contain `Markdown`, you can use `hMarkdown` as the search criteria. If the beginning character of the keyword to be searched is in the above list, you need to use `\` to escape. For example, if you want to search for the keyword `doc`, `d` will hit the document block filter, so that the keyword actually searched is `oc`, which needs to be escaped by `\doc`.
