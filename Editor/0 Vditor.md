The editor component of SiYuan is called "Vditor", which is a browser-side editor and an open source project designed and developed by us. It can be found at [here](https://github.com/Vanessa219/vditor). Based on Vditor, we developed the editor currently used in SiYuan, and we will continue to improve it in the future to bring you a more modern editing experience.
