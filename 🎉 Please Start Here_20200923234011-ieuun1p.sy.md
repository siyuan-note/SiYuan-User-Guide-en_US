{: id="20200923234102-fota8wn"}

In SiYuan, the only important core concept is ((20200924101106-19z4kaa "Content Block")). We can use **natural** ((20200924085905-kxykwln "Markdown Syntax")) to define content blocks, organize thoughts and knowledge in the granularity of content blocks, and also facilitate long text layout output.

SiYuan uses a technical architecture that separates the kernel and interface. The version packaged with Electron is only a small part of our vision. In the future, we will develop SiYuan based on the browser ecology, so that it has better openness. You can customize your favorite interface and functions through browser plugins. The future can be expected!
