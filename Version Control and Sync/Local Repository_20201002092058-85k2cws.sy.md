Siyuan Note uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to implement version management. After opening the local folder, the folder will be automatically initialized as a Git repository (the .git folder is generated to store Git metadata).
{: id="20201002092116-mlwbfkv"}

All changes to documents and resource files (such as creating, editing, renaming, and deleting) will be included in the version management, so that you can browse and roll back historical operations in the future. At present, SiYuan only supports browsing document editing history. If you need more support for Git operations, you can use any Git client to operate, but please note that after using external tools, please restart Siyuan Note.

If you don't need version management, you can turn it off in "Settings-Repository". #TODO#
