Welcome here, please allow me to make a brief introduction to SiYuan 😅

{: id="20200923234102-fota8wn"}

In SiYuan, the only important core concept is ((20200924101106-19z4kaa "Content Block")). We can use **natural** ((20200924085905-kxykwln "Markdown Syntax")) to define content blocks, organize thoughts and knowledge in the granularity of content blocks, and also facilitate long text typeset output.

## 🔮 Quick start

1. Open a local folder or connect to WebDAV
2. Use `((` to trigger the ((20200924101312-jj4e0v3 "Content block reference"))
3. ((20200924101200-gss5vee "Navigate in the content block"))
4. ((20200924100906-0u4zfq3 "Window and tab"))
