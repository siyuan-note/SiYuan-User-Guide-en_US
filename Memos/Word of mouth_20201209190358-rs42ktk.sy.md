In the early stage of SiYuan, users gave us some promotion suggestions: promote it on some media platforms (such as Zhihu, Bilibili, etc.).

Thank you very much for your help in considering this matter, but we have already decided at the beginning of the project: we will not actively promote it on any media platform.

This consideration is because we firmly believe that good products must be passed on by word of mouth from users. If no users are willing to help promote and spread, it means that the product is not good enough. We should spend our time and energy on design and development until the user agrees.

If you think the current SiYuan are not bad and have met or exceeded your expectations, then please help us to promote it, thank you üôè
