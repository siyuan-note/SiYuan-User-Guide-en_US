> Occam's Razor, Ockham's Razor (Occam's Razor, Ockham's Razor), also known as "Ockham's Razor", was developed by William of Occam (about 1285 To 1349). This principle is called "if not necessary, do not add entities", that is, "simple and effective principle". As he said in the "Notes to Proverbs" Volume 2, Volume 15, "Don't waste more things to do, use less things, the same thing can be done well."
