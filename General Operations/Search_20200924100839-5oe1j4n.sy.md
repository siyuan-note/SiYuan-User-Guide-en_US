Search mainly involves three functional points:

* Global text search, trigger the search box via <kbd>Ctrl P</kbd> / <kbd>âŒ˜ P</kbd>
* Content block quote/embed search, in the editor document by typing `((keyword` to trigger
* Relation graph search, filter nodes and connections based on keywords in the relation graph

The content block reference/embed search supports filtering by content block type, just enter the type identifier after `((`:

* `((d` Document block
* `((#` Heading block
* `((*` List block (including ordered list block, unordered list block and task list block)
* `((-` List item block
* ``((` `` Code block
* `((>` Blockquote block
* `(($` Mathematical formula block
* `((p` Paragraph block

Then continue to enter the search keywords. Similarly, global text search also supports type filtering. For example, if you want to search for all heading blocks containing `Markdown`, you can use `#Markdown` as the search criteria.
