After the PDF file is uploaded and inserted through the editor, the PDF will be placed in the assets folder of the document at the same level, and a link in the form of `[filename](assets/filename.pdf)` will be generated in the document. Right-click on the link and select a new tab in the resource drop-down menu to open the preview, or use the system default program to open the PDF file.
