## Bookmark

If you need to "favorite" a content block, you can move the mouse to the block identifier on the left side of the content block in the editor and click to display a drop-down menu. After selecting a bookmark, the block can be added to the favorite. Collection of document blocks is not supported. If there is a need to collect document blocks, you can write the title of the document in the document and achieve this by collecting the title block.

Currently, only the built-in bookmark marker (‚ú®üí°Ô∏è‚è≥) is supported to name bookmarks, and custom bookmark markers will be supported in the future. #TODO#

All favorite content blocks will be listed in the bookmark tab (<kbd>Alt 3</kbd> / <kbd>‚åò 3</kbd>). If you want to cancel the collection, select Delete in the drop-down menu of the content block ID.

## Tag

The tag is used to mark the block in the content block. The syntax is to wrap the tag identifier with two `#` in the first and one after the other, like this `#Tag#`.

Tag support hierarchical levels, so that content blocks can be sorted more easily. Use `/` to separate different levels, like this `#A/B/C#`.

All tagged content blocks will be listed in the tag tab (<kbd>Alt 4</kbd> / <kbd>‚åò 4</kbd>). If you need to cancel the tag, just delete the tag in the content block.
