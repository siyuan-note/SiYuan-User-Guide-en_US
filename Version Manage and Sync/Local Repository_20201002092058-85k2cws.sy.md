SiYuan uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to implement version management. After opening the local folder (not WebDAV), the folder will be automatically initialized as a Git repository (the .git folder is generated to store Git metadata).
{: id="20201002092116-mlwbfkv"}

All changes to documents and resource files (such as creating, editing, renaming, and deleting) will be included in the version management, so that you can browse for historical operations in the future:
{: id="20201002163713-dqfe40t"}

* Select History from the right-click drop-down menu of the editor tab
* Select History from the right-click drop-down menu of the file tree
{: id="20201002163713-xldjz7p"}

At present, SiYuan only supports browsing history. If you need more support for Git operations (such as rollback), please use the Git tool to operate. Note, please restart SiYuan after using external tools.
