SiYuan uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to implement version management. After opening the local folder (not WebDAV), the folder will be automatically initialized as a Git repository (the .git folder is generated to store Git metadata).

All changes to documents and resource files (such as creating, editing, renaming, and deleting) will be included in the version management (default is automatic submission at an interval of 10 minutes, which can be adjusted in Settings - Editor) so that they can be carried out in the future Browsing of historical operations:

* Select History from the right-click drop-down menu of the editor tab
* Select History from the right-click drop-down menu of the file tree

At present, SiYuan only supports browsing history. If you need more support for Git operations (such as rollback), please use the Git tool to operate. #Note#: please restart SiYuan after using external tools.
