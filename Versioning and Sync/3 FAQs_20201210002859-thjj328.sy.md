### What is "Git conflict markers"?
{: id="20201210002930-7cvn3j6"}

The conflicting place looks like this in the document text (you can open the document through an external text editor to view):

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Here is the original local content
=======
Here is the content pulled from the cloud
>>>>>>> feebfeb6bef44cf1384d51cdd7aef7e4197b8180
```

You can edit it manually, or you can use the diff tool to edit it.

## Why can't I sync empty folders?

This is the Git design. At least one file is required under the folder (the file content can be empty) to be included in version management.
