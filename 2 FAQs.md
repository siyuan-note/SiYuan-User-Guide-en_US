## Why is pit.exe reported as a Trojan virus?
{: id="20201228141919-1rv31v8"}

The pit.exe located in the resources folder of the installation directory is the SiYuan update program, which is responsible for pulling the update package from and decompressing the update.

## Why does WebDAV report error 503 after connecting?
{: id="20201231103013-nxyusb6"}

This error is returned by the WebDAV provider interface. Generally, it is because SiYuan calls the interface too frequently, which causes the provider to limit the interface service. When connecting to WebDAV, please specify the specific folder path in the service address column, such as: `https://dav.jianguoyun.com/dav/My Notes Folder/`, please do not use `https://dav.jianguoyun.com/dav/` directly.
